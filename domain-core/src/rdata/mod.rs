//! Resource data implementations.
//!
//! This module will eventually contain implementations for the record data
//! for all defined resource record types.
//!
//! The types are named identically to the [`Rtype`] variant they implement.
//! They are grouped into submodules for the RFCs they are defined in. All
//! types are also re-exported at the top level here. Ie., for the AAAA
//! record type, you can simple `use domain::rdata::Aaaa` instead of
//! `use domain::rdata::rfc3596::Aaaa` which nobody could possibly remember.
//! There are, however, some helper data types defined here and there which
//! are not re-exported to keep things somewhat tidy.
//!
//! See the [`Rtype`] enum for the complete set of record types and,
//! consequently, those types that are still missing.
//!

// The rdata_types! macro (defined in self::macros) reexports the record data
// types here and creates the MasterRecordData and AllRecordData enums
// containing all record types that can appear in master files or all record
// types that exist.
//
// All record data types listed here should have the same name as the
// `Rtype` variant they implement.
//
// Add any new module here and then add all record types in that module that
// can appear in master files under "master" and all others under "pseudo".
// In both cases, if your type is generic over a domain name type, add `<N>`
// to it (it canâ€™t be over anything else, so if you have more type arguments,
// you might have to either newtype with those removes or, God forbid, modify
// the macro). Each type entry has to be followed by a comma, even the last
// one.
