//! Building a new DNS message.
//!
//! DNS messages consist of five sections. The first, the *header section*
//! contain, among other things, the number of entries in the following four
//! section which then contain these entries without any further
//! delimitation. In order to safely build a correct message, it thus needs
//! to be assembled step by step, entry by entry. This module provides a
//! number of types that can be used to assembling entries in these sections.
//!
//! Message building happens by appending data to a [`BytesMut`] buffer. This
//! buffer is automatically grown to accomodate the data if necessary. It
//! does, however, consider the size limit that all DNS messages have. Thus,
//! when you start building by creating a [`MessageBuilder`], you can pass
//! an initial buffer size, a size limit, and a strategy for growing to its
//! [`with_params`][`MessageBuilder::with_params`] function. Alternatively,
//! you can create the message atop an existing buffer via
//! [`from_buf`][`MessageBuilder::from_buf`]. In this case you can adjust the
//! limits via methods such as [`set_limit`][`MessageBuilder::set_limit`].
//! 
//! All types allow to change the limit later. This is useful if you know
//! already that your message will have to end with an OPT or TSIG record.
//! Since for these you also know the size in advance, you can reserve space
//! by setting a lower limit and increase it only when finally adding those
//! records.
//!
//! Because domain name compression is somewhat expensive, it needs to be
//! enable explicitely through the 
//! [`enable_compression`][`MessageBuilder::enable_compression`] method.
//!
//! The inital [`MessageBuilder`] allows access to the two first sections of
//! the new message. The header section can be accessed via
//! [`header`][`MessageBuilder::header`] and
//! [`header_mut`][`MessageBuilder::header_mut`]. In addition, it is used for
//! building the *question section* of the message. This section contains
//! [`Question`]s to be asked of a name server, normally exactly one. You
//! can add questions using the [`push`][`MessageBuilder::push`] method.
//!
//! Once you are happy with the question section, you can proceed to the
//! next section, the *answer section,* by calling the
//! [`answer`][`MessageBuilder::answer`] method.
//! In a response, this section contains those resource records that answer
//! the question. The section is represented by the [`AnswerBuilder`] type.
//! It, too, has a [`push`][`AnswerBuilder::push`] method, but for adding
//! [`Record`]s.
//!
//! A call to [`authority`][`AnswerBuilder::authority`] moves on to the
//! *authority section,* represented by an [`AuthorityBuilder`]. It contains
//! resource records that allow to identify the name servers that are
//! authoritative for the records requested in the question. As with the
//! answer section, [`push`][`AdditionalBuilder`] adds records to this
//! section.
//!
//! The final section is the *additional section.* Here a name server can add
//! information it believes will help the client to get to the answer it
//! really wants. Which these are depends on the question and is generally
//! given in RFCs that define the record types. Unsurprisingly, you will
//! arrive at an [`AdditionalBuilder`] by calling the
//! [`additional`][`AuthorityBuilder::additional`] method once you are done
//! with the authority section. Adding records, once again, happens via the
//! [`push`][`AdditionalBuilder::push`] method.
//! 
//! Once you are done with the additional section, too, you call
//! [`finish`][`AdditionalBuilder::finish`] to retrieve the bytes buffer with
//! the message data or [`freeze`][`AdditionalBuilder::freeze`] to get the
//! [`Message`] instead.
//!
//! Since some of the sections are empty in many messages – for instance, a
//! simple request only contains a single question – there are
//! shortcuts in place to skip over sections. Each type can go to any later
//! section through the methods named above. Each type also has the `finish`
//! and `freeze` methods to arrive at the final data quickly.
//!
//! There is one more type: [`OptBuilder`]. It can be used to assemble an
//! OPT record in the additional section. This is helpful because the OPT
//! record in turn is a sequence of options that need to be assembled one
//! by one.
//!
//! Since OPT records are part of the additional section, an [`OptBuilder`]
//! can be retrieved from an [`AdditionalBuilder`] via its
//! [`opt`][`AdditionalBuilder::opt`] method. Options can then be added as
//! usually via [`push`][`OptBuilder::push`]. Once done, you can return to
//! the additional section with [`additional`][`OptBuilder::additional`] or,
//! if your OPT record is the final record, conclude message construction
//! via [`finish`][`OptBuilder::finish`] or [`freeze`][`OptBuilder::freeze`].
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! To summarize all of this, here is an example that builds a
//! response to an A query for example.com that contains two A records and
//! and empty OPT record setting the UDP payload size.
//!
//! ```
//! use std::str::FromStr;
//! use domain_core::bits::{Dname, MessageBuilder, SectionBuilder, RecordSectionBuilder};
//! use domain_core::iana::Rtype;
//! use domain_core::rdata::A;
//!
//! let name = Dname::from_str("example.com.").unwrap();
//! let mut msg = MessageBuilder::new_udp();
//! msg.header_mut().set_rd(true);
//! msg.push((&name, Rtype::A));
//! let mut msg = msg.answer();
//! msg.push((&name, 86400, A::from_octets(192, 0, 2, 1))).unwrap();
//! msg.push((&name, 86400, A::from_octets(192, 0, 2, 2))).unwrap();
//! let mut msg = msg.opt().unwrap();
//! msg.set_udp_payload_size(4096);
//! let _ = msg.freeze(); // get the message
