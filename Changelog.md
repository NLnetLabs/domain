# Change Log

## Unreleased future version

Breaking Changes

* The minimum supported Rust version is now 1.49. ([#107])

New

* ``base::header::Flag` for easier working for the flags of a message
  header. ([#109] by [@tomaskrizek])

  `Display` and `Debug`. ([#112])

  from the RRSIG length. ([#110] by [@vavrusa])

Other Changes

## 0.6.1

Released 2021-03-31.

This release is a maintenance release only in order to show the complete
documentation on docs.rs.

Other Changes

* Enables all features when building for doc.rs. ([#99])

[#99]: https://github.com/NLnetLabs/domain/pull/99


## 0.6.0

Released 2021-03-22.

Breaking

* The crate `domain-resolv` has been merged into this crate as the
  `domain::resolv` crate. It requires the `resolv` feature to be enabled.

* Upgrade to tokio 1.0, bytes 1.0, and latest of other dependencies
  ([#84] by [@koivunej])

New

* Support for extended errors defined in [RFC 8914]. ([#79] by [@xofyarg])
* New traits `domain::base::octets::OctetsFrom` and `OctetsInto` to
  convert types that are generic over octets sequences between different
  octets sequences. ([#77])

Bug Fixes

* Fix domain name compressors when giving a root label only. ([#76]
  by [@vavrusa])
* Fix OptIter not skipping over other options correctly. ([#76]
  by [@vavrusa])
* Fix canonical comparison of TXT RDATA by taking the length labels into
  account. ([#76] by [@vavrusa])
* Fix parser not rejecting malformed TXT RDATA. ([#80] by [@vavrusa])
* Resolver: Host lookup now considers possibly separate CNAME chains for
  the responses to the A and AAAA queries. ([#90] by [@varusa])

## 0.5.0

This release contains a major restructuring and refactoring of the entire
library. The previous set of crates has been merged into a single crate
yet again with various modules being optional and available via features.


### Changes to former *domain-core*

The following notes list the changes relative to the *domain-core* crate.

Reorganization

* The modules in `domain_core::bits` have been moved to `domain::base`.
* The modules `domain_core::{iana, utils}` have been moved to
  `domain::base::{iana, utils}` respectively.
* Master file parsing and generation functionality is now only available
  if the feature `"master"` is enabled.

Breaking Changes

* All types that use octets sequences are now generic over the specific
  type of sequence. For details of the mechanism, please have a look at
  the documentation of the `base::octets` module.
* `rdata::rfc4035::Nsec` is now generic over the type of the next name.
  This is necessary because [RFC 6762] allows compression for its next name.
  ([#20], reported by Tom Pusateri)
* Removed the failure crate. All error types now impl `fmt::Display` and,
  if the `"std"` feature is enabled, `std::error::Error`. [(#33)]

New

* `base::message::Message::opt` returns a message’s OPT record if present.
  ([#6], thanks to Marek Vavruša!)
* unsafe `base::name::Dname::from_bytes_unchecked` in order to create
  names from well-known sequences. [(#31)]
* `compose::Compose::compose_canonical` for composing the canonical form
  for DNSSEC signing. It has a default implementation just doing `compose`
  and has been implemented for all relevant types. [(#XX)]
* `base::cmp::CanonicalOrd` for the ordering of record data and records for
  DNSSEC signing. Implemented for all relevant types. Also improved
  implementations of `PartialEq` and `PartialOrd` for types generic over
  domain name types to be generic over the other values domain name type.
* Allow `serial::Serial` to be created from datetimes, provide a
  constructor for `now` and add `sub`.
* Record data types for CDS and CDSKEY record types. (Provided by [@vendemiat]
  in [#24]).

Bug fixes

* Do not compress the target of an SRV record’s data. [(#18)]
* Fix multiple issues with `rdata::rfc4043`. ([#42] via [#38] by [@vavrusa])
* Fix multiple issues with `base::opt`. ([#42] via [#38] by [@vavrusa])
* Fixed infinite loops in `Message::canonical_name`. ([#42] via [#38] by
  [@vavrusa])

Dependencies

* The `std`, `bytes`, and `chrono` crates are now optional and can be enabled
  via features.


### New

* The new `sign` module provides DNSSEC signing. It is available if the
  `"sign"` feature is enabled.
* The new `tsig` module provides TSIG signing and validation. It is only
  available if the `"tsig"` feature is enabled.
* The new `validate` module provides functionality necessary for DNSSEC
  validation. It is only available if the `"validate"` feature is enabled.
