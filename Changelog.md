# Change Log

## Unreleased next version

Breaking changes

* All types and functions referring to domain names have been changed from
  using the term “dname” to just “name.” For instance, `Dname` has become
  `Name`, `ToDname` has become `ToName`, and `ToDname::to_dname` has become
  `ToName::to_name`. ([#290])
* The `ToDname` and `ToRelativeDname` traits have been changed to have a
  pair of methods a la `try_to_name` and `to_name` for octets builders
  with limited and unlimited buffers, reflecting the pattern used
  elsewhere. ([#285])
* The types for IANA-registered parameters in `base::iana` have been
  changed from enums to a newtypes around their underlying integer type
  and associated constants for the registered values. (This was really
  always the better way to structure this.) ([#276], [#298])
* The `Txt` record data type now rejects empty record data as invalid. As
  a consequence `TxtBuilder` converts an empty builder into TXT record
  data consisting of one empty character string which requires
  `TxtBuilder::finish` to be able to return an error. ([#267])
* `Txt` record data serialization has been redesigned. It now serialized as
  a sequence of character strings. It also deserializes from such a sequence.
  If supported by the format, it alternatively deserializes from a string that
  is broken up into 255 octet chunks if necessary. ([#268])
* The text formatting for `CharStr` has been redesigned. The `Display`
  impl now uses a modified version of the representation format that
  doesn’t escape white space but also doesn’t enclose the string in
  quotes. Methods for explicitly formatting in quoted and unquoted
  presentation format are provided. ([#270])
* The `validate::RrsigExt` trait now accepts anything that impls
  `AsRef<Record<..>>` to allow the use of smart pointers. ([#288] by
  [@hunts])
* The stub resolver now uses the new client transports. This doesn’t change
  how it is used but does change how it queries the configured servers.
  ([#215])
* The sub resolver’s server configuration `Transport` type has been
  changed to be either `Transport::UdpTcp` for trying UDP and if that
  leads to a truncated answer try TCP and `Transport::Tcp` for only trying
  TCP. The stub resolver uses these accordingly now ([#296])
* Many error types have been changed from enums to structs that hide
  internal error details. Enums have been kept for errors where
  distinguishing variants might be meaningful for dealing with the error.
  ([#277])
* Renamed `Dnskey::is_zsk` to `is_zone_key`. ([#292])
* Split RRSIG timestamp handling from `Serial` into a new type
  `rdata::dnssec::Timestamp`. ([#294])
* Upgraded `octseq` to 0.5. ([#257])

New

* Add impls for `AsRef<RelativeDname<[u8]>>` and `Borrow<RelativeDname<[u8]>>`
  to `RelativeDname<_>`. ([#251] by [@torin-carey])
* Added `name::Chain::fmt_with_dots` to format an absolute chained name
  with a final dot. ([#253])
* Added a new `ParseAnyRecordData` trait for record data types that can
  parse any type of record data. ([#256])
* Added implementations of `OctetsFrom` and `Debug` to `AllOptData` and
  the specific options types that didn’t have them yet. ([#257])
* Added missing ordering impls to `ZoneRecordData`, `AllRecordData`,
  `Opt`, and `SvcbRdata`. ([#293])
* Added `Name::reverse_from_addr` that creates a domain name for the
  reverse lookup of an IP address. ([#289])
* Added `OptBuilder::clone_from` to replace the OPT record with the
  content of another OPT record. ([#299])
* Added `Message::for_slice_ref` that returns a `Message<&[u8]>`. ([#300])

Bug fixes

* Fixed the display implementation of `name::Chain<_, _>`. ([#253])
* Fixed the display implementation of `rdata::Txt<..>`. It now displays
  each embedded character string separately in quoted form. ([#259])
* Fixed the extended part returned by `OptRcode::to_parts` (it was shifted
  by 4 bits too many) and return all 12 bits for the `Int` variant in
  `OptRcode::to_int`. ([#258])
* Fixed a bug in the `inplace` zonefile parser that made it reject
  character string of length 255. ([#284])

Unstable features

* Add the module `net::client` with experimental support for client
  message transport, i.e., sending of requests and receiving responses
  as well as caching of responses.
  This is gated by the `unstable-client-transport` feature. ([#215],[#275])
* Add the module `net::server` with experimental support for server
  transports, processing requests through a middleware chain and a service
  trait.
  This is gated by the `unstable-server-transport` feature. ([#274])
* Add the module `zonetree` providing basic traits representing a
  collection of zones and their data. The `zonetree::in_memory` module 
  provides an in-memory implementation. The `zonefile::parsed` module
  provides a way to classify RRsets before inserting them into a tree.
  This is gated by the `unstable-zonetree` feature. ([#286])

## 0.9.0

Released 2023-09-18.

Breaking changes

* Move the `flatten_into` method for converting domain names into a
  straight, flat form into a new `FlattenInto` trait. This trait is only
  implemented for types that actually are or contain domain names. ([#216])
* Marked various methods and functions that return values without side
  effects as `#[must_use]`. ([#228] by [@WhyNotHugo])
* Changed the signature of `FoundSrvs::merge` to use a non-mut `other`.
  ([#232])
* The minimum Rust version is now 1.67. ([#235])

New

## 0.8.1

Released 2023-09-18

New

* Added a new method `FoundSrvs::into_srvs` that converts the value into an
  iterator over the found SRV records without resolving them further.
  ([#174], [#214] by [@WhyNotHugo]); this was added in 0.7.2 but missing
  in 0.8.0)
* Added impl of `Borrow<Dname<[u8]>>` and `AsRef<Dname<[u8]>>` for
  `Dname<_>`. ([#219] by [@iximeow}], [#225])
* Added `Dname::fmt_with_dot` that can be used when wanting to display a
  domain name with a dot at the end. ([#210])

Bug Fixes

* Fixed trait bounds on `FoundSrvs::into_stream` to make it usable again.
  ([#174], [#214 by [@WhyNotHugo]]; this was fixed in 0.7.2 but missing in
  0.8.0)
* Fixed scanning of domain names that are just the root label. ([#210])
* Fixed `util::base64::SymbolConverter` to also include the final group in
  the output if there is padding. ([#212])

## 0.8.0

Released 2023-05-12

Breaking Changes

* The minimal required Rust version is now 1.65. ([#160])
* The `random` feature has been dropped in favour of using `rand`.
  ([#204])
* The generic octets foundation has been moved to a new crate *[octseq]*
  and completely revamped with Generic Associated Types stabilized in Rust
  1.65. This required changes all over the code but, hopefully, should
  result in relatively few changes when using the crate. ([#160])
* The range, slice, and split methods on the domain name types have changed.
  They have been merge into a single method taking ranges – except for those
  on `Dname` that require type changes. The split methods now take references
  and don’t change `self` anymore. ([#160])
* The `Parse`, `Compose`, and `Scan` traits have been demoted to mere
  extension traits for foreign types (primarily the built-in integers, so that
  you can do things like `u16::parse`). All other types now simply have
  methods matching the patterns. Where generics are necessary, dedicated
  traits have been added. E.g., there now are `ParseRecordData` and
  `ComposeRecordData` traits that are implemented by all record data types.
  ([#160])
* The `Deref` and `DerefMut` impls have been removed for most types that
  had them to follow guidance that they are exclusively for use by pointer
  types – which none of them are. `len` and `is_empty` methods have been
  added where appropriate, additional methods may be added. ([#205])
* Various functions and methods of the `tsig` module now expect the
  current time as an argument to allow use of the module in a no-std
  environment. ([#152])
* Parsing of representation format and zonefiles has been completely
  re-written. ([#142], based on work in [#109] by [Martin Fischer])
* All types that wrap an octets sequence only now allow unsized octets
  sequence types. They all have an associated function `from_slice` to
  create a reference to a value wrapping an (unsized) octets slice and
  method `for_slice` that converts a `&self` into such a reference. Where
  the latter already existed but returned a value wrapping a `&[u8]` (e.g.,
  `Dname<_>` and `Message<_>`, the return type has changed accordingly.
  ([#168])
* Removed `CharStr::from_bytes`. Use `CharStr::from_octets` instead. ([#168])
* `Message::from_octets` now returns a new error type `ShortMessage`. ([#168])
* Dropped `Deref` impls for `Dname<_>`, `RelativeDname<_>`. ([#168])
* Renamed `opt::KeyTag::new` to `opt::KeyTag::from_octets`. ([#168])
* Renamed `rdata::Txt::try_from_slice` to `build_from_slice`. ([#168])
* The `new` method of the following record data types now check whether
  the wire format representation of the record data is too long and thus
  returns a result: `Tsig<_, _>`, `Dnskey<_>`, `Rrsig<_, _>`, `Ds<_>`, 
  `Cdnskey<_>`, `Cds<_>`. ([#169])
* The `new` function for `rdata::Null<_>` has been replaced with a
  `from_octets` and `from_slice` pair. The `Deref` impl was removed. ([#169])
* The `rdata::svcb` module has been refactored to work in the same way as
  other type-length-value constructs. The names of types, methods, and
  functions have changed both to match the usual nomenclature as well as
  to match the terms used in the SVCB draft. ([#176])
* The `base::iana::SvcbParamKey` type has been renamed to `SvcParamKey`
  to match the terms used in the SVCB draft. ([#176])
* The `TcpKeepalive` option has been changed to use an `Option<u16>` as
  its data and allow for an empty option in accordance with the RFC.
  ([#185])
* Renamed the sub-modules of `rdata` that contain record data types to use a
  name derived from their content rather than their RFC number – with the
  exception of `rdata::rfc1035`. ([#189])
* Renamed the sub-modules of `base::opt` that contain option data types to
  use short-hand names rather than their RFC number. ([#190])
* TTL values are now using a newtype `base::record::Ttl` that wraps the
  raw `u32` and improves conversions. ([#202] by [@CrabNejonas])
* Changes all option data types to ensure their wire format is at most
  65,535 octets long. This requires changing the signatures of some
  creator functions. Their naming scheme and signatures are also changed
  to follow the pattern established with record data. ([#193])
* Renamed `UnknownOptData::from_octets` to `new` and return a result. ([#193])
* Completely redesigns DNS cookie options, adding support for standard server
  cookies introduced in RFC 9018. ([#193])
* Change the type of `ExtendedError`’s text to `Str<Octs>` and change the
  return type of `set_text` to `()`. ([#193])
* Changed the type `TcpKeepalive`’s content to a newtype `IdleTimeout` to
  make it easier to convert to and from durations. ([#193])
* Changes Padding to just contain the padding octets and drop `PaddingMode`.
  Instead, the methods on `OptBuilder` should be used to add padding. ([#193])

New

* `Display` impls are now available for all EDNS0 options. ([#157])
* Adds a `FromStr` implementation and related functions to
  `RelativeDname`. ([#177])
* Add a `Debug` impl to `base::message::Message` so it can be unwrapped
  etc. ([#199])
* New methods `make_canonical` on `Dname` and `RelativeDname` that convert
  the name into its canonical, i.e., lowercase form. Similarly, new
  methods `ToDname::to_canonical_dname` and
  `ToRelativeDname::to_canonical_relative_dname` that produce new
  canonical names. ([#200])
* Added a `MAX_LEN` constant to various types that wrap length-limited
  octets sequences. ([#201] by [@CrabNejonas])

## 0.7.2

Released 2023-03-02

New

* Added a new method `FoundSrvs::into_srvs` that converts the value into an
  iterator over the found SRV records without resolving them further.
  ([#174])

  ([#174])

[#174]: https://github.com/NLnetLabs/domain/pull/174


## 0.7.1

Released 2022-10-06.

New

* Added a method `flatten_into` to record data types that  converts a
  value with a parsed (and thus possibly compressed) domain name into a one
  with a normal domain name. ([#151] by [@xofyarg])

Other Changes

* Disable default features for chrono. ([#149] by [@vavrusa])

[@vavrusa]: https://github.com/vavrusa
[@xofyarg]: https://github.com/xofyarg


## 0.7.0

Released 2022-09-15.

Breaking Changes

* The minimum supported Rust version is now 1.56.1. ([#128])
* The `OctetsBuilder` trait does not require `AsRef<[u8]>` and
  `AsMut<[u8]>` any more. These have been added as explicit trait bounds
  where needed. In return, `Cow<[u8]>` can now be used as an octets
  builder where `AsMut<[u8]>` is not needed. ([#130]).
* The `Display` implementation for `UncertainDname` now ends an absolute
  name with a dot to match the behaviour of the `FromStr` implementation.
  ([#116])
* The salt and hash parameters of `Nsec3` and `Nsec3Param` have been
  wrapped in newtypes. ([#116])
* Functions depending on the `rand` crate have been moved behind a new
  `random` feature as `rand` is not available on all systems, even with
  std support. The feature is, however, part of the default features.

  In particular, this means that `Header::set_random_id`,
  `MessageBuilder::request_axfr`, and `opt::rfc7830::PaddingMode::Random`
  are only available if the feature is enabled. ([#117] by @Jezza)
* `resolv::Resolver::Query` now has to be `Send`. This will allow the
  resolver to be used in async functions spawned onto a Tokio runtime.

  The stub resolver’s query struct is already Send, so no actual changes
  are necessary. However, because this changes the definition of the Resolver
  trait, this is a breaking change, anyway. ([#125])

New

* ``base::header::Flag` for easier working for the flags of a message
  header. ([#109] by [@tomaskrizek])
* `base::name::OwnedLabel` now implements `Clone` and `Copy` as well as
  `Display` and `Debug`. ([#112])
* `base::record::Record::into_owner_and_name` allows decomposing a record
  into its two parts that aren’t `Copy`. ([#114])
* Initial support for SVCB and HTTPS record types. ([#115] by [@xofyarg])
* Introduced Serde support for all relevant types. ([#116])
* The `OctetsBuilder` trait is now also implemented for mutable references
  of types that are octet builders and turn into themselves when frozen
  (i.e., `OctetsBuilder::Octets = Self`). ([#121])
* Support for [`heapless::Vec<u8, N>`] as an octets sequence via the new
  `heapless` feature. ([#122] by [@bugadani])
* The parameter types for SVCB record data now also implement `Eq`
  ([#135])

Bug Fixes

* Correctly encode and decode the address in EDNS client subnet when the
  number of bits isn’t divisible by 8. ([#101] and [#102] by [@xofyarg])
* `validate`:
  * Check for the correct public key size instead of infering if
    from the RRSIG length. ([#110] by [@vavrusa])
  * Canonalize the security algorithm before evaluation to avoid missing
    algorithm provided via the unknown integer variant. ([#127] by [@vavrusa])
* Support for no-std environments now actually works. ([#117] by @Jezza)
* Canonalize IANA types when scanning so that, e.g., `CLASS3` becomes
  `Class::Ch` instead of `Class::Int(3)`. ([#127] by [@vavrusa])
* `resolv`: Fixed generation of the domain name to be used for reverse
  IPv6 lookups. ([#131])

Other Changes

* Enable `doc_cfg` feature flag documentation for docs.rs.

## 0.6.1

Released 2021-03-31.

This release is a maintenance release only in order to show the complete
documentation on docs.rs.

Other Changes

* Enables all features when building for doc.rs. ([#99])

[#99]: https://github.com/NLnetLabs/domain/pull/99


## 0.6.0

Released 2021-03-22.

Breaking

* The crate `domain-resolv` has been merged into this crate as the
  `domain::resolv` crate. It requires the `resolv` feature to be enabled.
  The `sync` feature from `domain-resolv` has been renamed to
  `resolv-sync`. ([#74])
* The trait `domain::base::octets::IntoOctets` has been merged into
  `domain::base::octets::OctetsBuilder`. It’s method `into_octets` is now
  available as `freeze` on `OctetsBuilder`. ([#75])
* Upgrade to tokio 1.0, bytes 1.0, and latest of other dependencies
  ([#84] by [@koivunej])

New

* Support for extended errors defined in [RFC 8914]. ([#79] by [@xofyarg])
* New traits `domain::base::octets::OctetsFrom` and `OctetsInto` to
  convert types that are generic over octets sequences between different
  octets sequences. ([#77])

## 0.5.0

This release contains a major restructuring and refactoring of the entire
library. The previous set of crates has been merged into a single crate
yet again with various modules being optional and available via features.


### Changes to former *domain-core*

The following notes list the changes relative to the *domain-core* crate.

Reorganization

* The modules in `domain_core::bits` have been moved to `domain::base`.
* The modules `domain_core::{iana, utils}` have been moved to
  `domain::base::{iana, utils}` respectively.
* Master file parsing and generation functionality is now only available
  if the feature `"master"` is enabled.

Breaking Changes

* All types that use octets sequences are now generic over the specific
  type of sequence. For details of the mechanism, please have a look at
  the documentation of the `base::octets` module.
* `rdata::rfc4035::Nsec` is now generic over the type of the next name.
  This is necessary because [RFC 6762] allows compression for its next name.
  ([#20], reported by Tom Pusateri)
* Removed the failure crate. All error types now impl `fmt::Display` and,
  if the `"std"` feature is enabled, `std::error::Error`. [(#33)]

New

* `base::message::Message::opt` returns a message’s OPT record if present.
  ([#6], thanks to Marek Vavruša!)
* unsafe `base::name::Dname::from_bytes_unchecked` in order to create
  names from well-known sequences. [(#31)]
* `compose::Compose::compose_canonical` for composing the canonical form
  for DNSSEC signing. It has a default implementation just doing `compose`
  and has been implemented for all relevant types. [(#XX)]
* `base::cmp::CanonicalOrd` for the ordering of record data and records for
  DNSSEC signing. Implemented for all relevant types. Also improved
  implementations of `PartialEq` and `PartialOrd` for types generic over
  domain name types to be generic over the other values domain name type.
* Allow `serial::Serial` to be created from datetimes, provide a
  constructor for `now` and add `sub`.
* Record data types for CDS and CDSKEY record types. (Provided by [@vendemiat]
  in [#24]).

Bug fixes

* Do not compress the target of an SRV record’s data. [(#18)]
* Fix multiple issues with `rdata::rfc4043`. ([#42] via [#38] by [@vavrusa])
* Fix multiple issues with `base::opt`. ([#42] via [#38] by [@vavrusa])
* Fixed infinite loops in `Message::canonical_name`. ([#42] via [#38] by
  [@vavrusa])

Dependencies

* The `std`, `bytes`, and `chrono` crates are now optional and can be enabled
  via features.


### New

* The new `sign` module provides DNSSEC signing. It is available if the
  `"sign"` feature is enabled.
* The new `tsig` module provides TSIG signing and validation. It is only
  available if the `"tsig"` feature is enabled.
* The new `validate` module provides functionality necessary for DNSSEC
  validation. It is only available if the `"validate"` feature is enabled.
