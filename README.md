A library for interacting with the Domain Name System. The crate contains
an ever-growing set of building blocks for including DNS functionality in
applications.


Currently, these blocks include:

* basic data structures and functionality for creating and parsing DNS
  data and messages,
* experimental support for DNS client and server transports,
* support for signing and verifying messages using the TSIG mechanism,
* experimental support for reading data from DNS zone files,
* experimental and as yet incomplete support for DNSSEC signing and
  validation,
* a simple Tokio-based stub resolver.

If you have ideas, requests, or proposals for future features, please
don’t hesitate to open Github issues.


## Minimal Supported Rust Versions

We are trying to maintain a decent balance between being able to use older
compiler versions and using new features that improve safety and usability
of the crate.

### Minimum version: 1.68.2

The `rust-version` given in `Cargo.toml` is the oldest version that can
be used to compile the crate with the minimal versions of all dependencies
selected.

You can run `cargo +nightly update -Z minimal-versions` to ask Cargo to
select these minimal versions for all dependencies.

### Current version: 1.76.0

This is the minimum Rust version required to build with latest version of
all dependencies at time of release. `Cargo.lock` contains these versions
for reference.

## Licensing

The domain crate is distributed under the terms of the BSD-3-clause
license. See the [LICENSE] file for details.
