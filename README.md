A library for interacting with the Domain Name System. The crate contains
an ever-growing set of building blocks for including DNS functionality in
applications.


Currently, these blocks include:

* basic data structures and functionality for creating and parsing DNS
  data and messages,
* support for signing and verifying messages using the TSIG mechanism,
* experimental support for reading data from DNS master files (also known
  as zone files),
* experimental and as yet incomplete support for DNSSEC signing and
  validation,
* a simple Tokio-based stub resolver.

If you have ideas, requests, or proposals for future features, please
don’t hesitate to open Github issues.
