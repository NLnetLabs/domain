/// [`Self::to_message`] function. Alternatively, for complete control use the
/// getter functions on [`Answer`] instead and construct a response message
/// yourself using [`MessageBuilder`].

/// Implementers of alternate backing stores for [`Zone`]s will need to use
/// one of the various `Answer` constructor functions when

/// tailor the DNS message produced by [`Self::to_message`] based on the
/// outcome of the query.
