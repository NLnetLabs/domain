//! A DNS library for Rust.
//!
//! This crates provides a number of building blocks for developing
//! functionality related to the DNS. It provides fundamental types, traits,
//! and code as well as a wide range of optional features. The intent is to
//! eventually cover all aspects of modern DNS.
//!
//! The crate uses feature flags to allow you to select only those modules
//! you need for you particular project. In most cases, the feature names
//! are equal to the module they enable.
//!
//! # Modules
//!
//! A set of modules providing fundamental types and functionality is always
//! enabled:
//!
//! * [base] contains a wide variety of types, traits, and functionality
//!   to deal with DNS data, and
//! * [rdata] contains types and implementations for a growing number of
//!   record types.
//!
//! In addition to those two basic modules, there are a number of modules for
//! more specific features that are not required in all applications. In order
//! to keep the amount of code to be compiled and the number of dependencies
//! small, these are hidden behind feature flags through which they can be
//! enabled if required. The flags have the same names as the modules.
//!
//! Currently, there are the following modules:
//!
#![cfg_attr(feature = "master", doc = "* [master]:")]
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "master"), doc = "* master:")]
//!   Experimental reading and writing of master files – also known
//!   as zone files –, i.e., the textual representation of DNS data. This
//!   module will be re-implemented in the near future and will be renamed to
//!   _zonefiles._
#![cfg_attr(feature = "resolv", doc = "* [resolv]:")]
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "resolv"), doc = "* resolv:")]
//!   An asynchronous DNS resolver based on the
//!   [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) async runtime.
#![cfg_attr(feature = "sign", doc = "* [sign]:")]
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "sign"), doc = "* sign:")]
//!   Experimental support for DNSSEC signing.
#![cfg_attr(feature = "tsig", doc = "* [tsig]:")]
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "tsig"), doc = "* tsig:")]
//!   Support for securing DNS transactions with TSIG records.
#![cfg_attr(feature = "validate", doc = "* [validate]:")]
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "validate"), doc = "* validate:")]
//!   Experimental support for DNSSEC validation.
//!
//!
//! # Reference of Feature Flags
//!
//! The following is the complete list of the feature flags available.
//!
//! * `bytes`: Enables using the types `Bytes` and `BytesMut` from the
//!    [bytes](https://github.com/tokio-rs/bytes) crate as octet sequences.
//! * `chrono`: Adds the [chrono](https://github.com/chronotope/chrono)
//!   crate as a dependency. This adds support for generating serial numbers
//!   from time stamps.
//! * `heapless`: enables the use of the `Vec` type from the
//!   [heapless](https://github.com/japaric/heapless) crate as octet
//!   sequences.
//! * `interop`: Activate interoperability tests that rely on other software
//!   to be installed in the system (currently NSD and dig) and will fail if
//!   it isn’t. This feature is not meaningful for users of the crate.
//! * `master`: Zone file parsing and construction. This will enable the
#![cfg_attr(feature = "master", doc = "  [master]")]
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "master"), doc = "  master")]
//!   module and currently enables the `bytes`, `chrono`, and `std`
//!   features. Note that feature and module are experimental and will soon
//!   be replaced.
//! * `random`: Enables a number of methods that rely on a random number
//!   generator being available in the system.
//! * `resolv`: Enables the asynchronous stub resolver via the
#![cfg_attr(feature = "resolv", doc = "  [resolv]")]
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "resolv"), doc = "  resolv")]
//!   module.
//! * `resolv-sync`: Enables the synchronous version of the stub resolver.
//! * `ring`: Enables crypto functionality via the
//!   [ring](https://github.com/briansmith/ring) crate.
//! * `serde`: Enables serde serialization for a number of basic types.
//! * `sign`: basic DNSSEC signing support. This will enable the
#![cfg_attr(feature = "sign", doc = "  [sign]")]
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "sign"), doc = "  sign")]
//!   module and requires the `std` feature. Note that this will not directly
//!   enable actual signing. For that you will also need to pick a crypto
//!   module via an additional feature. Currently we only support the `ring`
//!   module, but support for OpenSSL is coming soon.
//! * `smallvec`: enables the use of the `Smallvec` type from the
//!   [smallvec](https://github.com/servo/rust-smallvec) crate as octet
//!   sequences.
//! * `std`: support for the Rust std library. This feature is enabled by
//!   default.
//! * `tsig`: support for signing and validating message exchanges via TSIG
//!   signatures. This enables the
#![cfg_attr(feature = "tsig", doc = "  [tsig]")]
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "tsig"), doc = "  tsig")]
//!   module and currently pulls in the
//!   `bytes`, `ring`, and `smallvec` features.
//! * `validate`: basic DNSSEC validation support. This feature enables the
#![cfg_attr(feature = "validate", doc = "  [validate]")]
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "validate"), doc = "  validate")]
//!   module and currently also enables the `std` and `ring`
//!   features.
