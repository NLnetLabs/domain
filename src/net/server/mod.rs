//! Receiving requests and sending responses.
//!
//! This module provides skeleton asynchronous server implementations based on
//! the [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) async runtime. In combination with an
//! appropriate network source, optional middleware services and your own
//! [`Service`] implementation, they can be used to run a standards compliant
//! DNS server that answers requests based on the application logic you
//! specify.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! A layered stack of components is responsible for handling incoming
//! requests and outgoing responses:
//!
//! ```text
//! --> network source                         - reads bytes from the client
//!     --> server                             - deserializes requests
//!         --> (optional) middleware services - pre-processes requests
//!             --> service                    - processes requests &
//!             <--                              generates responses
//!         <-- (optional) middleware services - post-processes responses
//!     <-- server                             - serializes responses
//! <-- network source                         - writes bytes to the client

//!
//! # Getting started
//!
//! Servers are implemented by combining a server transport (see [dgram] and
//! [stream]), [`BufSource`] and [`Service`] together. Middleware [`Service`]
//! impls take an upstream [`Service`] instance as input during construction
//! allowing them to be layered on top of one another, with your own
//! application [`Service`] impl at the peak.
//!
//! Whether using [`DgramServer`] or [`StreamServer`] the required steps are
//! the same.
//!
//!   - Create an appropriate network source (more on this below).
//!   - Construct a server transport with `new()` passing in the network
//!     source and service instance as arguments.
//!     - (optional) Tune the server behaviour via builder functions such as
//!       `with_config()`.
//!   - `run()` the server.
//!   - `shutdown()` the server, explicitly or on [`drop`].
//!
//! See [`DgramServer`] and [`StreamServer`] for example code to help you get
//! started.
//!
//! # Core concepts
//!
//! ## Network transports
//!
//! Historically DNS servers communicated primarily via datagram based
//! connection-less network transport protocols, and used stream based
//! connection-oriented network transport protocols only for zone transfers.
//!
//! Modern DNS servers increasingly need to support stream based
//! connection-oriented network transport protocols for additional response
//! capacity and connection security. This module provides support for both
//! via the [`DgramServer`] and [`StreamServer`] types respectively.
//!
//! ## Datagram (e.g. UDP) servers
//!
//! [`DgramServer`] can communicate via any "network source" type that
//! implements the [`AsyncDgramSock`] trait, with an implementation provided
//! for [`tokio::net::UdpSocket`].
//!
//! The type alias [`UdpServer`] is provided for convenience for
//! implementations based on [`tokio::net::UdpSocket`].
//!
//! ## Stream (e.g. TCP) servers
//!
//! [`StreamServer`] can communicate via any "network source" type that
//! implements the [`AsyncAccept`] trait, and whose associated stream type
//! implements the [`tokio::io::AsyncRead`] and [`tokio::io::AsyncWrite`]
//! traits, with an implementation provided for [`tokio::net::TcpListener`]
//! and associated stream type [`tokio::net::TcpStream`].
//!
//! The type alias [`TcpServer`] is provided for convenience for
//! implementations based on [`tokio::net::TcpListener`].
//!
//! ## Middleware
//!
//! [Middleware] provides a means to add logic for request pre-processing and
//! response post-processing which doesn't belong in the outermost transport
//! specific layer of a server nor does it constitute part of the core
//! application logic.
//!
//! Mandatory functionality and logic required by all standards compliant DNS
//! servers can be incorporated into your server by layering your service on
//! top of [`MandatoryMiddlewareSvc`]. Additional layers of behaviour can be
//! optionally added from a selection of [pre-supplied middleware] or
//! middleware that you create yourself.
//!
//! ## Application logic
//!
//! With the basic work of handling DNS requests and responses taken care of,
//! the actual application logic that differentiates your DNS server from
//! other DNS servers is left for you to define by implementing the
//! [`Service`] trait yourself and passing an instance of that service to the
//! server or middleware service as input.
//!
//! # Advanced
//!
//! ## Memory allocation
//!
//! The allocation of buffers, e.g. for receiving DNS messages, is delegated
//! to an implementation of the [`BufSource`] trait, giving you some control
//! over the memory allocation strategy in use.
//!
//! ## Dynamic reconfiguration
//!
//! Servers in principle support the ability to dynamically reconfigure
//! themselves in response to [`ServerCommand::Reconfigure`] while running,
//! though the actual degree of support for this is server implementation
//! dependent.
//!
//! ## Performance
//!
//! Calls into the service layer from the servers are asynchronous and thus
//! managed by the Tokio async runtime. As with any Tokio application, long
//! running tasks should be spawned onto a separate threadpool, e.g. via
//! [`tokio::task::spawn_blocking()`] to avoid blocking the Tokio async
//! runtime.
//!
//! ## Clone, Arc, and shared state
//!
//! Both [`DgramServer`] and [`StreamServer`] take ownership of the
//! [`Service`] impl passed to them.
//!
//! For each request received a new Tokio task is spawned to parse the request
//! bytes, pass it to the first service and process the response(s).
//! [`Service`] impls are therefore required to implement the [`Clone`] trait,
//! either directly or indirectly by for example wrapping the service instance
//! in an [`Arc`], so that [`Service::call`] can be invoked inside the task
//! handling the request.
//!
//! There are various approaches you can take to manage the sharing of state
//! between server instances and processing tasks, for example:
//!
//! | # | Difficulty | Summary | Description |
//! |---|------------|---------|-------------|
//! | 1 | Easy | `#[derive(Clone)]` | Add `#[derive(Clone)]` to your [`Service`] impl. If your [`Service`] impl has no state that needs to be shared amongst instances of itself then this may be good enough for you. |
//! | 2 | Medium | [`Arc`] wrapper | Wrap your [`Service`] impl instance inside an [`Arc`] via [`Arc::new`]. This crate implements the [`Service`] trait for `Arc<Service>` so you can pass an `Arc<Service>` to both [`DgramServer`] and [`StreamServer`] and they will [`Clone`] the [`Arc`] rather than the [`Service`] instance itself. |
//! | 3 | Hard | Do it yourself | Manually implement [`Clone`] and/or your own locking and interior mutability strategy for your [`Service`] impl, giving you complete control over how state is shared by your server instances. |
