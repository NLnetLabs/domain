//! Support for working with response streams needed by all middleware.
//!
//! Like application services all middleware implementations implement the
//! [`Service`] trait and so return a [`futures::stream::Stream`] of
//! responses.
//!
//! A middleware [`Service`] may respond immediately, or pass the request to
//! the next [`Service`] above and then handle the response or responses
//! returned by the upper layer, either passing them through unchanged or
//! post-processing them depending on the purpose of the middleware.
//!
//! Unlike an application service, middleware is not completely in control of
//! the type of response stream that it returns, and may even return a
//! different type in different circumstances. A middleware that passes the
//! responses from the upper service through unchanged must return whatever
//! type of response stream the upper service generates. A middleware that
//! responds immediately returns its own type of response stream. And
//! middleware that post-processes responses received from the upper service
//! may transform the upper service response type to a different response
//! type.
//!
//! The [`MiddlewareStream`] and [`PostprocessingStream`] types provided by
//! this module are intended to simplify and standardize the way that
//! middleware implementations handle these cases.
