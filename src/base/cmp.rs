//! Additional traits for comparisions.
//!
//! These traits exist because there are several ways of compare domain
//! names included in composite structures. Normally, names are compared
//! ignoring ASCII case. This is what `PartialEq` and `PartialOrd` do for
//! domain names. Consequently, when comparing resource records and record
//! data that contain domain names, ASCII case should also be ignored.
//!
//! However, the canonical form of most resource type’s record data (apart
//! from a small set of well-known types) requires names to be considered
//! as they are for comparisons. In order to make it clear when this mode
//! of comparision is used, this module defines a new trait [`CanonicalOrd`]
//! that allows types to define how they should be compared in the context of
//! DNSSEC. The trait is accompanied by `compose_canonical` methods on all
//! types that have or may have a canonical form.

/// A trait for the canonical sort order of values.
///
/// The canonical sort order is used in DNSSEC when multiple values are
/// part of constructing or validating a signature. This sort order differs
/// in some cases from the normal sort order. To avoid confusion, only this
/// trait should be used when DNSSEC signatures are involved.
///
/// Canonical order is defined in [RFC 4034] and clarified in [RFC 6840]. It
/// is defined for domain names and resource records within an RR set (i.e.,
/// a set of records with the same owner name, class, and type).
///
/// For domain names, canonical order is the same as the ‘normal’ order as
/// implemented through the `PartialOrd` and `Ord` traits: Labels are compared
/// from right to left (i.e, starting from the root label) with each pair of
/// labels compared as octet sequences with ASCII letters lowercased
/// before comparison.  The `name_cmp` methods of the
/// [`ToDname`][crate::base::name::ToName::name_cmp] and
/// [`ToRelativeDname`][crate::base::name::ToRelativeName::name_cmp]
/// traits can be used to implement this canonical order for name types.
///
/// Resource records within an RR set are ordered by comparing the canonical
/// wire-format representation of their record data as octet sequences. The
/// canonical form differs from the regular form by lower-casing domain names
/// included in the record data for the record types NS, MD, MF, CNAME, SOA,
/// MB, MG, MR, PTR, MINFO, MX, RP, AFSDB, RT, SIG, PX, NXT, NAPTR, KX, SRV,
/// DNAME, A6, and RRSIG. (NSEC is listed in [RFC 4034] but has been withdrawn
/// by [RFC 6840]). This canonical representation is provided via the
/// `Compose::compose_canonical` method.
///
/// In order to help implementing this trait for record data types, there are
/// implementations of it for some types that can appear in record data that
/// sort differently in their composed representation than normally.
///
/// Apart from these explicit use cases, the `CanonicalOrd` trait is also
/// implemented for the `Record` type to allow ordering records of a zone into
/// RRsets. It does so by ordering by class first, then canonical owner,
/// record type, and finally canonical record data. The reason for this
/// somewhat odd ordering is that in this way not only are all records
/// for the same owner name and class kept together, but also all the records
/// subordinate to a owner name and class pair (i.e., the records for a zone)
/// will sort together.
