//! Tooling for interop testing.
//!
//! This project provides the scaffolding for testing the interoperability of
//! the `domain` crate with various other DNS implementations out there.
//!
//! The actual tests live with their respective modules in a sub-module called
//! `interop`. Since they require additional software packages to be available
//! and can be expensive, they are tagged as ignored by default.
